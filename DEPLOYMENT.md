## ðŸš€ Production Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Update with production values
VITE_NHOST_SUBDOMAIN=your-production-subdomain
VITE_NHOST_REGION=your-production-region
```

### 2. Build for Production
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run type checking
npm run type-check

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### 3. Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel --prod

# Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
```

### 4. Deploy to Netlify
```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Upload dist/ folder to Netlify
# Set environment variables in Netlify dashboard
```

### 5. Deploy to AWS S3 + CloudFront
```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Upload to S3 bucket
aws s3 sync dist/ s3://your-bucket-name --delete

# Invalidate CloudFront cache
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID --paths "/*"
```

## ðŸ”§ Production Configuration

### Hasura Production Settings
- [x] Enable CORS for your domain
- [x] Set up proper authentication
- [x] Configure rate limiting
- [x] Enable query depth limiting
- [x] Set up monitoring and logging
- [x] Configure backup strategies

### n8n Production Settings
- [x] Use production webhook URLs
- [x] Set up proper error handling
- [x] Configure retry mechanisms
- [x] Set up monitoring and alerts
- [x] Use environment variables for secrets

### Security Checklist
- [x] All API keys stored securely
- [x] HTTPS enabled for all endpoints
- [x] CORS properly configured
- [x] Input validation implemented
- [x] Rate limiting enabled
- [x] Authentication tokens secured
- [x] Database permissions locked down

## ðŸ“Š Performance Monitoring

### Metrics to Monitor
- [ ] Page load times
- [ ] API response times
- [ ] Error rates
- [ ] User engagement
- [ ] Database performance
- [ ] Real-time connection stability

### Recommended Tools
- Google Analytics for user tracking
- Sentry for error monitoring
- Vercel Analytics for performance
- Hasura Cloud monitoring
- n8n execution monitoring

## ðŸ”„ Maintenance Tasks

### Regular Updates
- [ ] Update dependencies monthly
- [ ] Monitor security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Review and optimize database queries
- [ ] Update AI model configurations
- [ ] Review user feedback and analytics

### Backup Strategy
- [ ] Database backups (automated via Nhost)
- [ ] n8n workflow backups
- [ ] Environment configuration backups
- [ ] Code repository backups

## ðŸŽ¯ Performance Targets

### Frontend Performance
- First Contentful Paint: < 1.5s
- Largest Contentful Paint: < 2.5s
- Cumulative Layout Shift: < 0.1
- First Input Delay: < 100ms

### Backend Performance
- GraphQL query response: < 200ms
- AI response time: < 10s
- Real-time message delivery: < 500ms
- Database query time: < 100ms

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Authentication failures**: Check Nhost configuration
2. **GraphQL errors**: Verify permissions and schema
3. **AI responses not working**: Check n8n workflow and OpenRouter API
4. **Real-time updates failing**: Verify WebSocket connections
5. **Build failures**: Check TypeScript errors and dependencies

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check build
npm run build

# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Linting
npm run lint

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```
